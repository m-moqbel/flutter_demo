# flutter_demo

A flutter sample app.

## Getting Started

This project is a flutter sample app to experiment with the framework and show implementation of some design patterns such as MVVM. 

Using the app, the user can:
- Add a post with an image and some text. 
- View available posts as a list.

Don't ask me why the image is stored in sqlite as base64 because why not? We are just experimenting.
